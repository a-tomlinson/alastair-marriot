    <h3><strong>Alastair Marriott</strong> internationally acclaimed Choreographer and Principal Character artist of The Royal Ballet.</h3>

  <p>Due to my training and a long career performing within The Royal Ballet I have become very proud of my classical heritage and use this as a basis for my language when creating a new work. As I develop my sense of self my voice as a choreographer has also developed, pushing and challenging these classical beginnings.</p>
  <p>When making a new work I believe it should also be challenging musically and artistically as well as technically if our art form is to continue to develop and resonate with modern audiences. Therefor collaboration is very important to me, not only with dancers in the studio but also with composers, artists and designers. In my career I have been fortunate enough to have worked with some of the worlds most renowned and sought after composers, artists and designers including Mark Anthony Turnage, Mark Wallinger and Es Devlin.'</p>
  <p>When working in the studio I have always been keen to spot new talent often using young dancers alongside very distinguished stars to give my works the best casting I can find and therefore creating a nurturing effect amongst the cast.</p>
